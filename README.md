# OpenSpire
Sugary Spire P Rank Build 1.01 decompilation.  
We're working on fixing sprites and all that, so adding anything will mess with some stuff in-game.

Whenever a new build gets in our hands, we will implement everything that's new.  
If it is YYC, I will waste my time recreating everything from scratch.

# Dependencies
- GameMaker 2023.6
- A brain, preferably not smooth
